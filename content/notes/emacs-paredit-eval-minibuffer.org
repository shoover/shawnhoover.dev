I've had paredit enabled in the eval expression minibuffer forever, but recently
pressing RETURN inserts a newline instead of, you know, evaluating the
expression. No idea what changed; maybe something weird in upgrading to Emacs 29.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/101uwgd/enable_paredit_mode_for_evalexpression_mini/][r/emacs]] has a couple ideas for folks who set up paredit with =use-package=.

For my .emacs setup, it goes like this.

Before:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook 'enable-paredit-mode)
#+end_src

After:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook 'eval-minibuffer-enable-paredit-hook)

(defun eval-minibuffer-enable-paredit-hook ()
  (enable-paredit-mode)
  (unbind-key (kbd "RET") paredit-mode-map))
#+end_src
