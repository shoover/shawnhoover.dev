I needed to poke an HTTP connection pool and observe connections being reused or
reset. On Windows I would reach for SysInternals Process Monitor straight away,
but it was suprisingly hard to find solid recommendations for MacOS.

The answer is Wireshark. Case closed. It has way more power than I needed, but
it was also super easy to set up and use for exactly what I needed. Install
Wireshark, run it, pick a network interface, click Start, click through the
recommended driver installation, set a quick filter for the TCP port and SYN
flags. Done.
